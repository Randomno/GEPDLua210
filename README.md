# What is this? #

This repository contains various Lua scripts for use with the BizHawk emulator, mainly targeting Goldeneye 007 for Nintendo 64. 

# Who am I? #

I'm a professional programmer and a veteran speedrunner of Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark. I've also created numerous TASes for these games.

# How to run #

1. Download the latest version of BizHawk (tasvideos.org).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Load Goldeneye 007 in BizHawk.
4. Goto "Tools" -> "Lua Console" and then "Script" -> "Open script" and select the script you wish to run.

The runnable scripts are located in the root folder of the repository. At the moment of writing, there are two runnable scripts, Map.lua and GuardDataViewer.lua.
