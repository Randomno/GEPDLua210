# How to run: #

1. Download the latest version of BizHawk (tasvideos.org).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Load Goldeneye 007 in BizHawk.
4. For later versions of BizHawk, Goto "Config" -> "Customize..." -> "Advanced" and switch to "Lua+LuaInterface" instead of "NLua+KopiLua". Otherwise parsing of .map files will fail.
5. Goto "Tools" -> "Lua Console" and then "Script" -> "Open script" and select the script you wish to run.

The runnable scripts are located in the root folder of the repository. At the moment of writing, there are two runnable scripts, Map.lua and GuardDataViewer.lua.
